	<h1>My Story</h1>
	<p>I grew up in Diverse Central New Jersey surrounded by New York, Philadelphia and the Jersey Shore. I attended a Private Boarding Highschool, The Peddie School, where I was exposed to my interests in Computer Science as a participant on the Robotics Team for 3 years. My team won 2nd in our regional tournaments my Junior and Senior years.
	<br>
	<br>I started attending Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio in 2015, where I was attracted to their strong Engineering Program and Unique and International student body.
	<br>
	<br>At CWRU I have learned to push my limits and succeed in the face of adversity. Being able to see myself accomplish tasks I never thought I could has kept me motivated to learn as much as I can at my time at CWRU.
	</p>
	<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
	<p><strong>Fitness/Exercise: </strong>
	<br>I attend the gym 5 times a week.
	<br><strong>Cooking: </strong>
	<br>This usually means I watch cooking videos and attempt unsuccessful recreations to eat.
	<br><strong>Music/Radio: </strong>
	<br>I am a large fan of Electronic/House/Ambient music, and have hosted multiple radio shows at my college's radio station, WRUW.
	<br><strong>Urban Exploration/Photography: </strong>
	<br>I enjoy travelling to new cities and wandering around the streets searching for lovely views and unique architecture.
