	<h1>My Story</h1>
	<p>My whole life, I grew up in Diverse Central New Jersey surrounded by New York, Philadelphia and the Jersey Shore. I attended a Private Boarding Highschool, The Peddie School, where I was exposed to my interests in Computer Science as a participant on the Robotics Team for 3 years. There I found success as my team won 2nd in our regional tournaments my Junior and Senior years. Additonally, surrounded by students of various backgrounds and cultures, this school is where the seeds of my International Studies academic interests began.
	<br>
	<br>I started attending Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio in 2015, where I was attracted to their strong Engineering Program and Unique and International student body. At CWRU I have learned to push my limits and succeed in the face of adversity.
	<br>
	<br>I became a leader by joining the Undergraduate Student Government, CWRU Model UN, International Studies Honor Society and CWRUHack. Wihtin these organizations I have found personal and organizational success in each by: winning 3 Awards in my Model UN career and becoming the Head Delegate of the organization; becoming the President of the International Honors Society; being a vocal advocate for Engineering/Social Science cross-disciplinary work; and participating in CWRUHackathon and various CWRUHack events.
  <br>
	<br>I have surpassed all expectations for myself as a leader and individual. Seeing myself accomplish tasks I never thought I could has kept me motivated to learn as much as I can at my time at CWRU.
	<br>
	<br>I am not done growing yet.

	<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
	<p><strong>Reading International News: </strong>
	<br>I enjoy reading updates from various International News Outlets (Current favorite is South China Morning Post)
	<br>This interest coincides with my International Studies Capstone which I wrote on
	<br>"Understanding the Effect of Real Estate Markets and New Wealth in Developing New Cities in China"
	<p><strong>Fitness/Exercise: </strong>
	<br>I attend the gym 5 times a week.
	<br><strong>Cooking: </strong>
	<br>This usually means I watch cooking videos and attempt unsuccessful recreations to eat.
	<br><strong>Music/Radio: </strong>
	<br>I am a large fan of Electronic/House/Ambient music, and have hosted multiple radio shows at my college's radio station, WRUW.
	<br><strong>Urban Exploration/Photography: </strong>
	<br>I enjoy travelling to new cities and wandering around the streets searching for unique architecture and good conversations. (Next cities to explore on my list are Melbourne and Panama City)
