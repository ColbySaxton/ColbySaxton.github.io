The Project
-----------
This project was centered around building a fully functional IoT connected Lamp with a Touchscreen, Web application, Mobile application and Facial Recognition Login. The Lampi is powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ running Rasbian Stretch Lite. The lampi has LED lights that are controlled using the pigpio library.

The project uses SSH to log in to my Pi and to log in to my Amazon Web Services EC2 instance.

This project uses ansible as a method to install the professor's correct solution to weekly assignments.

This Lamp was made in a course at CWRU called Introduction to Connected Devices.
