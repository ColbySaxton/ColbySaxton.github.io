Lattice-Based Encryption Research Paper
---------------------------------------
This project surrounds research upon a security topic within Computer Science called Lattice Encryption. This project was done within a class called Data Privacy and the paper was done in conjunction with another student.

While my partner investigated the challenges of Lattice Encryption moving forward as well as more detailed idea behind the theory, I investigated Encryption Schemas and Applications of Lattice Encryption. The various applications I described within the paper are applications in Group Signatures, Homomorphic Encryption, Internet of Things, Oblivious Transfer, Genomic Susceptibility Testing, Blockchain and E-Voting.

I describe in more detail the applications and encryption schemas used within each application in the full paper below.
