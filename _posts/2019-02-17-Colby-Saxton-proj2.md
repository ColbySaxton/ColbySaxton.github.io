Sizzle
------
This application was created at CWRUHackathon in February 2019. A team of myself and 3 of my peers collectively created this application over a 3 day span.

This Application shows the average user which locations or events are popular at any given time by tracking user location data. Additionally locations/vendors can place events on this application therefore users can make an informed decision as to what various events may be available at any given time.

My role for this project was to create the backend service. My partner and I working on the backend utilized an SQLAlchemy database where location data as well as name, description and date were stored. The backend interacted with the frontend utilizing Python's socket and JSON libraries to connect to the mobile device and be able to send SQL Queries and entries back and forth in the application.
